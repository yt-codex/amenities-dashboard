# Apps Script Placeholder (Milestone 0)

This folder will contain Google Apps Script source for the ETL pipeline in later milestones.

Planned responsibilities:
- Pull/transform amenity and denominator data into compact planning-area aggregates.
- Produce quarterly snapshot outputs for the static frontend.
- Run updates via Apps Script time-based triggers (no GitHub Actions scheduling).
